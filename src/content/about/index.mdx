    Hi, I'm Daniel. My curiosity drives me to dive into a bit of everything. I believe the best ideas come from connecting dots across different fields.

    This site is where I document that process. It's a collection of my projects, thoughts, and lessons learned along the way. My goal is to share practical insights that you can use in your own work.
