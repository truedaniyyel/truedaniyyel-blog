    Hi, I’m Daniel. My curiosity drives me to dive into a bit of everything, convinced that the best ideas come from connecting dots across different fields.

    This leads me to a process of gathering data, understanding all the moving parts, and finding ways to build better systems, usually through automation.

    This site is where I share that process. It’s a collection of projects, thoughts, and lessons learned along the way, all with the goal of providing practical insights for your own work.
